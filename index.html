        </div>
        <div class="text-box" id="about-me-text">
          <p>As you’ve probably guessed already, my name is Georgia! I’m twenty-five
            and I’m from London, but also spent part of my childhood living in
            Sao Paulo, Brazil. When I’m not writing code, I enjoy going to the
            theatre, watching Game of Thrones and practising yoga. Since graduating
            in 2016, I’ve volunteered at the Rio Olympics, worked on a cruise
            ship, and until recently I was working at a FinTech startup. Over
            the last few months, I have been teaching myself to code full time.</p>
          <p>I'm also a Scout Leader and have been involved in Scouting for the
            past fifteen years. We’re currently working on our World Challenge
            Badge, which requires the Scouts to spend time volunteering within
            the local community, to explore environmental and international
            issues and to make contact with Scouts in a different country. I
            love bringing subjects to life for our young adults. Recently, I ran
            a meeting where we analysed UN data on the experiences
            of women in different parts of the world. We began the evening by
            playing a few mixed gender team games, which were then rewarded with
            sweets. The girls quickly realised they had been ‘under-rewarded’
            compared to the boys, and this sparked outrage! We discussed how
            this made them feel, and asked everyone if girls and boys should
            receive equal reward for equal effort - and got a resounding yes!
            (And don’t worry, the girls were fairly compensated at the end of
            the meeting).</p>
          <h4>My interest in coding</h4>
          <p>I’ve always been an inquisitive person, and the CodeFirst:Girls course
            I took last year fuelled my curiosity in programming. I’d considered
            many careers while at university and after graduating, but hadn’t
            found something that felt right for me. Coding is the creative outlet
            I had been searching for; I left my first CodeFirst:Girls meeting
            feeling like a door had been opened into a whole new world, and that
            passion for coding has stayed with me. Since then, I’ve completed
            a Python course with CodeFirst:Girls, and I'm currently working on a
            twelve week programme to get my Scouts interested in coding while
            they earn a Digital Maker Badge. I’m also creating a website where
            Scouts can play games that teach them to code - it’s still in the
            design stages, but I’m hoping to get it running over the summer.</p>
          <p>Working at a startup, I enjoyed being encouraged to solve problems,
            to take responsibility and to challenge myself and others. I’ve seen
            how collaborative and hard working tech teams can be, and know I
            would thrive in an environment where I can work closely with others
            while coding and being creative. </p>
          <h4>Why Founders and Coders</h4>
          <p>Working at a startup, I have also witnessed the lack of diversity
            in the tech industry. Learning to code myself, and teaching my
            Scouts (half of whom are girls) to code, is my small way of making a
            change. I know that Founders and Coders is an open and inclusive
            community that embraces diversity, which is the kind of environment
            I want to learn in.</p>
          <p>I like how Founders and Coders gives its developers exposure to
            clients from the nonprofit sector and with this, the chance to work
            on projects that could potentially make a real difference to people’s
            lives. Also, having the opportunity to return as a mentor (both in
            London and possibly abroad), and to contribute to the curriculum and
            the learning of others seems like a great opportunity and
            something I’d really enjoy doing.</p>

        <h3 id="my-website-title">About my website</h3>
        <div id="application-text">
          <h4>What's gone well</h4>
            <p>I’m really happy with the aesthetics of my website, and I feel
              much more confident in my knowledge of HTML and CSS now. I feel like
              I’ve come a long way from the website I made on my CodeFirst:Girls
              course last year, which was really not very mobile friendly at all!
              So I’m proud that this one works well on both mobile and desktop,
              and everywhere in between. I’ve enjoyed flexing my Javascript
              skills on this project and have worked hard to use a few different
              examples - it’s been tough, but when you see your code working and
              your website come to life, it’s so rewarding!</p>
          <h4>What I can improve on</h4>
            <p>If I was starting this project again, I would definitely go for a
              mobile first approach. I didn’t realise how challenging it would be
              to go back and add mobile designs afterwards and in hindsight, I
              should have started with mobile and scaled up from there. I’m happy
              with the colours I’ve chosen, and feel like they give my website a
              clean, fresh and minimalistic feel. However, while I have no problems
              viewing the website, I’m also aware this might not be the case for
              people who have visual impairments. In the future, I’ll give more
              thought to creating an accessible colour scheme, therefore making sure
              my work is as user friendly as possible. I feel like I could have
              been more structured in my naming of classes and ids and while I feel
              my structure is clear enough, it’s definitely something I’ll focus
              on more as I progress. I think all three of these improvement points
              have highlighted how important it is to allocate time for planning
              and designing at the beginning of every project - it might feel
              like you’re starting too slowly at first, but it saves a lot of
              headache later on!</p>

              final project, which is on my Github account, too.</p>
            <p>Thank you so much for checking out my website,
              and I hope to hear from you soon! I’ll be hiking in Scotland from
              11th to 18th May 2019, so the best way to contact me is over email.</p>
